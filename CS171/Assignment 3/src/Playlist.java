/*  This class represents a Playlist of podcast episodes, where each
/*  episode is implemented as an object of type Episode. A user navigating
/*  a Playlist should be able to move between songs using Next or Previous.
/*
/*  To enable flexible navigation, the Playlist is implemented as
/*  a Circular Doubly Linked List where each episode has a link to both
/*  the next and the prev episodes in the list.
/*
/*  Additionally, the last Episode is linked to the head of the list (via next),
/*  and the head of the list is linked to that last Episode (via prev). That said,
/*  there is NO special "last" reference keeping track of the last Episode.
/*  But there is a "head" reference that should always refer to the first Episode.
